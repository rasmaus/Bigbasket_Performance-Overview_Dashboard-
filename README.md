### **The Business Problem**

For a large e-commerce platform like BigBasket, understanding which products and categories are driving sales and how customers perceive brand value is crucial. Without a centralized, interactive view, it's difficult to spot trends, identify underperforming areas, and analyze the relationship between price, ratings, and sales.

* Breaks down sales by product category to identify top contributors.  
* Highlights the top 10 brands by revenue.  
* Allows for dynamic filtering by category and customer rating to uncover specific insights.  
* Visualizes the correlation between product price and customer ratings.

### **Walkthrough of Key Visuals**

* **KPI Cards**: At the top, key metrics such as **Total Sales**, **Highest Rated Brands**, **Total Products**, **Avg Discount**, and **Avg Rating** provide an immediate snapshot of overall performance.  
* **Category-wise Sales Treemap**: This visual shows the proportion of sales contributed by each main category. Larger rectangles represent higher sales.  
* **Top 10 Brands by Revenue Bar Chart**: Displays the highest-grossing brands, enabling a clear view of market leaders.  
* **Scatter Plot (Product Price vs Rating)**: This chart plots individual products to reveal the relationship between their price and customer ratings.  
* **Slicers (Categories & Ratings)**: Interactive buttons allow users to filter the entire dashboard to enable deep-dive analysis.

## **📈 Business Impact & Insights**
